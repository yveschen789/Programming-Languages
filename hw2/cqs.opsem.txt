For questions 1--7, please read pages 26--34 (the book sections on
environments and on operational semantics of expressions).
These questions are multiple-choice.  Questions 1 to 3 offer one set
of choices, and questions 4 to 6 offer another set of choices.

 1. $\xi$ is an environment that maps names to

    (a) *only* user-defined functions.
    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.
    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.
    (d) the values of *both* global variables and formal parameters.
    (e) *only* primitive functions.
    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

    (f)


 2. $\phi$ is an environment that maps names to

    (a) *only* user-defined functions.
    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.
    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.
    (d) the values of *both* global variables and formal parameters.
    (e) *only* primitive functions.
    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

    (c)

 3. $\rho$ is an environment that maps names to

    (a) *only* user-defined functions.
    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.
    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.
    (d) the values of *both* global variables and formal parameters.
    (e) *only* primitive functions.
    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

    (b)

 4. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $e$ stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) an elaboration
    (d) an expression
    (e) a value
    (f) a function

    (d)

 5. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $v$ stand for?

    (a) an environment

 7. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    phrase $\rho\{x \mapsto 7\}\{x \mapsto 8\}$ stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) an elaboration

    (e) a value
    (f) a function

    (c)

Questions 8 and 9 are also based on
pages 26--34.
Please answer a number.

 8. How many rules have the IF syntactic form in the conclusion?

    2

 9. How many rules have the APPLY syntactic form in the conclusion?
    (Look at all the rules in the section, not just the
    summary on page 77.)

    1

Now let's understand a subtle point about rules. Study the FormalVar
and FormalAssign rules starting on page 30.  In FormalVar, the initial
and final states have the same $\rho$.  But in the FormalAssign rule,
there is an initial state with $\rho$, an intermediate state with
$\rho'$, and a final state with $\rho'\{x \mapsto v\}$.  Answer these
questions:

10. In rule FormalVar, the initial and final state have the same $\rho$ because

    (a) Evaluating $x$ might change the value of some formal parameter.
    (b) Evaluating $x$ might not change the value of any formal parameter.
    (c) Evaluating $x$ doesn't change the value of any formal parameter.

    (c)
      
11. In rule FormalAssign, there is an intermediate state with $\rho'$
    (rho-prime) because

    (a) Evaluating $e$ might change the value of some formal parameter.
    (b) Evaluating $e$ might not change the value of any formal parameter.
    (c) Evaluating $e$ doesn't change the value of any formal parameter.

    (a)

When a rule is used in a derivation, it doesn't look exactly the way
it looks in isolation.  Regrettably, section 1.6.1, which starts on page 54 
does not really explain how to construct a derivation.  But look at
the example derivation on page 56, and
answer this question:

12. The same $\rho$ is used throughout the derivation because

    (a) Every subexpression is known, and because there is no unknown
        subexpression, there is no need for a $\rho'$ (rho-prime).
    (b) No part of the evaluation changes the value of a formal parameter.
    (c) The example derivation takes a shortcut and doesn't actually
        conform to the rules.
