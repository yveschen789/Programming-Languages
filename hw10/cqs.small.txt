1. *Receivers, arguments, and message names.*
    Read the first eleven pages of chapter 10, through
    the end of section 10.1.4.
    Now examine these expressions from the definition of class
    `Picture`, in figure 10.4 on page 653:

        (shapes add: aShape)
        (shape drawOn: aCanvas)
        (shapes do: [block (shape) (shape drawOn: aCanvas)])

    In each expression, please identify the *receiver*, the
    *argument*, and the *message name*:

    > In `(shapes add: aShape)`,
    >
    >   - The receiver is ... shapes
    >   - The argument is ... aShape
    >   - The message name is ... add:

    > In `(shape drawOn: aCanvas)`,
    >
    >   - The receiver is ... shape
    >   - The argument is ... drawOn
    >   - The message name is ... aCanvas

    > In `(shapes do: [block (shape) (shape drawOn: aCanvas)])`,
    >
    >   - The receiver is ... shapes
    >   - The argument is ... do:
    >   - The message name is ... [block (shape) (shape drawOn: aCanvas)]


    _You can now start to read code examples._

 2. *Colons in message names*.
    Now move on to class `TikzCanvas`, which is described in 
    Figures 10.5 and 10.6 on page 654.
    In both the protocol and the implementation, method `startDrawing`
    has no colon in the name, method `drawPolygon:` has one colon in
    the name, and method `drawEllipseAt:width:height:` has three colons 
    in the name.

      - What, if anything, does the number of colons have to do with
        *receivers*? 

        Your answer: ... the correct method to call based on colons

      - What, if anything, does the number of colons have to do with
        *arguments*? 

        Your answer: ... the number of arguements

    If you need to, review the presentation in section 10.1.1 
    on "Objects and Messages," which shows messages sent to shapes.


    _You now know what a message's name tells you about how to use it._


 3. *Class protocols and instance protocols.*
    Every *message* is part of some *protocol*.  As example messages,
    study the transcript in code chunks 648b and 648c, which
    puts three shapes into a picture and then draws the picture.

    (a) Of the message names used in the transcript, which ones are
        part of the _class_ protocol for `Picture`?
        
        add:

        Which message names are part of the _instance_ protocol for
        `Picture`?

        (val pic (Picture empty))
    
        Which message names are part of the _class_ protocol for
        `TikzCanvas`?
        
        begin, draw, end

        Which message names are part of the _instance_ protocol for
        `TikzCanvas`?

        (TikzCanvas new)

    (b) In general, what do you do with messages in a _class_
        protocol, and how does that differ from what you do with
        messages in an _instance_ protocol?

        the message protocals are handled by an instance of the class

    _You now know what you can do with each kind of message described
    in the chapter._

 4. *Dynamic dispatch, part I: A toy class*.
    For the mechanisms of message send and dynamic dispatch, read
    section 10.3.4, which starts on page 666.  Using the class definitions
    in that section, message `m1` is sent to an object of class `C`.
    What method *definitions* are dispatched to, in what order?

    Please edit this answer to put in the correct methods and classes:

      - Dispatch to method m1 on class (self m2)
      - Dispatch to method  m2 on class 'C
        ...

    _You are starting to understand the key mechanism behind all of
    object-oriented programming._

 5. *Dynamic dispatch, part II: Conditionals? What conditionals?*
     Read section 10.5.1 (page 689) in its entirety.
     (It is less than one page.)

     Now study this transcript:

        -> ('hello isNil)
        <False>
        -> (nil isNil)
        <True>
        -> ('hello class)
        <class Symbol>
        -> (('hello class) superclass)
        <class Object>
        -> (nil class)
        <class UndefinedObject>
        -> ((nil class) superclass)
        <class Object>

    Answer these two questions:

    (a) Explain how it is possible that the `isNil` method can be
        implemented without an equality test and without any explicit
        conditional test (like an `if`).  Your explanation should
        include a statement of what messages are sent to what objects
        and what method definition each message dispatches to.

        the method clas itself will know its status of nil or not and
        return that boolean since the result was created upon instanciation

    (b) Explain _why_ it is desirable to implement object-oriented
        code without explicit conditional tests, and indeed, without
        ever asking an object, "how were you formed?"

        Makes abstraction easier and one can understand attributes of an 
        object by knowing its class, not its formation and properties

    _You are starting to learn how to work effectively in a world
    where we don't interrogate objects to see how they were formed or
    what class they are._

 6. *Dynamic dispatch, part III: Number classes.*
    Familiarize yourself with the protocols for magnitudes and
    numbers, as described in section 10.4.6, which starts on page 684.
    Now turn to section 10.5.8, which starts on page 700, and examine
    the key methods of class `Number`, as well as the 
    implementation of class `Fraction` (page 703).
    Part of class `Fraction` is relegated to the Supplement, but the
    only thing you need from there is this implementation of method
    `negated` on class `Fraction`:    
     
        (method negated () ((Fraction new) setNum:den: (num negated) den))

    Now, demonstrate your understanding of dynamic dispatch by
    explaining what messages are sent when fractions are subtracted.  
    For example, what messages are sent when we evaluate

        ((1 / 2) - (1 / 3)) / - /

    The computation dispatches messages to instance methods of classes
    `Fraction`, `Number`, and `SmallInteger`, as well as a class method of
    class Fraction.  We are interested in only *some* of those
    dispatches---ones that meet *both* of these criteria:

      - The message is sent from a method defined on class `Fraction`
        or class `Number`.

      - The message is received by an _instance_ of class `Fraction` or
        class `Number`.

    These criteria rule out *class* methods of class `Fraction`,
    messages sent to `SmallInteger`, and so on.

    Starting with what happens when message `-` (minus) is sent to an
    instance of `Fraction`, please identify only the interesting
    dispatches:

        Message   Sent from method     Sent to object      Method defined
                  defined on class     of class            on class

        -          (anywhere)          Fraction            Number

        /         Number               Fraction            Number

                         ... fill in the ? marks ...

                  ... and complete the rest of this table ...


    _You are starting to learn how a class can have some of its work
    done for it by its superclass._

 7. *Dynamic dispatch, part IV: Messages to `self` and `super`.*
    Now study the *class* method `new` defined on class `List`, which
    appears in section 10.5.6, which starts on page 696.
    The definition sends message `new` to `super`.  (Keep in mind:
    because `new` is a *class* method, both `super` and `self` stand
    for the class, not for any instance.)

    (a) When *class* method `new` is executed, what three messages
        are sent by the method body, in what order?  (If you like, you
        can use the message tracer described under ["Diagnostic
        technique"](#tracing) below, but it is probably easier just 
        to look at the source code.)

         1)  addFirst:

         2)  addLast:

         3)  pred:

    (b) What does each of the three message sends accomplish?

         1) instantiate first cons cell

         2) instantiatie rest 

         3) return new list


    (c) If we change `new`'s definition so instead of `(super new)` it 
        says `(self new)`, which of the following scenarios best describes
        how the changed program behaves?

        A.  The `new` message will be dispatched to class `List`.
            The same method will run again, and the computation will
            not terminate.

        B.  The `new` message will be dispatched to a different class,
            and the reply to the `new` message will leave the sentinel
            pointing to the wrong value.

        C.  Nothing will change; in this example, there's no
            difference between `(super new)` and `(self new)`.

        Your answer: The best description is labeled with letter ?

        B

    _You are learning how to use `super` to initialize objects._

 8. *Design of the numeric classes.*
    Read about coercion in section 10.4.6 on page 684.
    Look at the last part of the instance protocol for `Number` on page 685,
    which shows the contracts of methods `asInteger`, `asFraction`,
    `asFloat`, and `coerce:`.  If you are unsure, look at the
    implementations of these methods on class `Integer`, starting
    on page 702.

    Answer the two questions (a) and (b).  *Write no English.*

    (a) Supposing `x` is a variable that holds a number---possibly a
        floating-point number.  In C or C++, you can cast its value to
        `int` by writing `(int) x`.  In uSmalltalk, what code do you write?

        > ...(set x (int coerce: x))

    (b) Now suppose you have a uSmalltalk variable `y`, which also
        holds a number.  You want to add `x` and `y`, but the contract
        of the `+` message says that it can be used only when
        `x` and `y` have the same representation (both integers, both
        floats, etcetera).  *Without* interrogating either `x` or `y`
        to ask what class it is, how can you add them safely?  What
        code do you write?

        > (x asFloat) + y (assuming y is a float and x is not)

    You are ready to implement mixed arithmetic, with coercions, in exercise 39.


    _You are now ready to implement *all* of the operations on
    numbers, not just the ones that are familiar from C or C++._


 9. *Abstract classes in principle.*
    In section 10.10.1, which starts on page 740 ("Key words and phrases"),
    you will find a short definition of "abstract class."  What is the
    *purpose* of an abstract class?  Pick one of the responses below.

    (a) To hide the representation of instances so programmers can
        change internal details without affecting client code

    (b) To define methods that other classes inherit, so that
        subclasses get useful default methods

    (c) The same as the purpose of a regular class: to define an abstraction

    b

    Your answer: ...


    _You now know what abstract classes are supposed to do, so that
    when you tackle the homework, you can take advantage of abstract
    classes like `Magnitude`, `Number`, and `Integer`._

10. *Abstract classes in practice: magnitudes and numbers.*
    Your natural-number class will inherit from abstract class
    `Magnitude`, and your large-integer code will inherit from
    `Magnitude` and from `Number`, which is also an abstract class.

    (a) Study the implementation of class `Magnitude` (page 691).
        List all the methods that are “subclass responsibility”:

            Your answer:  = <

        These are methods that you must implement in both your
        `Natural` class and your large-integer classes.

    (b) On page S431 of [the Supplement to *Build, Prove, and
        Compare*](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/supplement.pdf),
        you will find the definition of class Number, which I will
        save you the trouble of looking up:

            (class Number
                [subclass-of Magnitude]  ; abstract class
                ;;;;;;; basic Number protocol
                (method +   (aNumber)     (self subclassResponsibility))
                (method *   (aNumber)     (self subclassResponsibility))
                (method negated    ()     (self subclassResponsibility))
                (method reciprocal ()     (self subclassResponsibility))
                
                (method asInteger  ()     (self subclassResponsibility))
                (method asFraction ()     (self subclassResponsibility))
                (method asFloat    ()     (self subclassResponsibility))
                (method coerce: (aNumber) (self subclassResponsibility))
                <<other methods of class [[Number]]>>
            )

        Your large-integer classes will be subclasses of `Number`.
        How many of the eight `subclassResponsibility` methods will
        you have to implement in those classes?

            Your answer: + * negated reciprocal

        (Two of these methods, `+` and `*`, must also be implemented
        in class `Natural`.)

    _You now understand in detail what operations your large integers
    must support._

11. *Double Dispatch*.
    Read section 10.5.8, which starts on page 700.  And read the section
    "laws for multiple dispatch" in the 7th lesson on program design
    (["Program Design with Objects"](../design/lessons.pdf)).  (This
    lesson was edited on April 11; to see the correct syntax, **you
    need to download a fresh copy**.)

    Now, of the methods on class `Number` listed in the previous
    question, list each one that needs to know *either* of the
    following facts about its *argument* (not its receiver):

      - Whether the argument is large or small
      - If the argument is large, whether it is "positive" or "negative"

    For example, `+` is such a method.

    (a) Please list all such methods here:

        Your answer: + * 


    (b) The methods in part (a) are exactly the ones that require
        double dispatch.  The implementation of each such method sends
        a message to its *argument*, and the exact message depends on
        the class of the *receiver*.  

        Assume that the receiver is a `LargePositiveInteger`.  Please
        say, for each method in part (a), what message the method
        implementation sends to the argument.

        Your answer:

        > Method `+` sends `addLargePositiveIntegerTo:` to the argument  
        > Method '*' sends 'mulLargePositiveIntegerTo:' to the arguement
        

    _You are ready to implement arithmetic on large integers (exercise 38)._
